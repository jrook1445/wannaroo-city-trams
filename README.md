# Wannaroo City Trams

NewGRF for OpenTTD - Passenger, courier, and goods trams including articulated vehicles. Fork of Zephyris' Generic Tram Set v0.4

1. About
    
    Passenger, courier, and goods trams including articulated vehicles. Fork of Zephyris' Generic Tram Set v0.4. I wanted to update this set with some new stats and also ensure it could refit to new cargos. Also an opportunity to work with some nfo. :thinking:
    
1. Compatibility
    
    Compatibility with any newgrf is not guaranteed. No warranties are expressed or implied. Not tested with OpenTTD versions < 1.7.2.

    Not valid for Toyland.

1. Features

    * Passenger trams refit to tourists.
    * Courier trams refit to mail + armoured cargo.
    * Goods trams refit to express cargo + water.
    * Adjustments to intro year, costs, speed, capacity, power, & weight.
    * Last generation does not expire.

1. Development

    A single nfo file (plus a png and a wav), compiled with grfcodec. I built this newgrf on Linux Mint 19.3 using grfcodec version 6.0.6 r991.
